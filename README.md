# Bias Projection Exercise (FAIRMODE WG5)

The Forum for Air Quality Modeling (FAIRMODE) was established in 2007 as a collaborative initiative by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) to address air quality modeling challenges. It is currently chaired by the Joint Research Centre.

This repository includes code for evaluating various techniques to mitigate bias in air quality (AQ) scenarios, with a specific focus on the  FAIRMODE WG5 exercise. Although primarily tailored for this exercise, the methods and tools provided can also be applied more broadly to reduce bias in AQ scenarios beyond the FAIRMODE framework
