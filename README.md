# FAIRMODE-WG5

This repository includes code for evaluating various techniques to mitigate bias in air quality (AQ) scenarios, with a specific focus on the FAIRMODE WG5 exercise. Although primarily tailored for this exercise, the methods and tools provided can also be applied more broadly to reduce bias in AQ scenarios beyond the FAIRMODE framework
